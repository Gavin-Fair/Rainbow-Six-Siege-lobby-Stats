Uses R6Tracker to show you the stats of every player in your Rainbow Six Siege Lobby
- Must install tesseract OCR to work https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Only works on Windows operating systems
- Won't work for all players as not all players are in R6 Tracker's database, but most are
- Recomended to use task scheduler to autmatically run script when you open game
